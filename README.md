I created this portfolio in 2019 when I dedicated a lot of time to learning about web development with the aim of transitioning from being a German & Polish teacher and translator to a front-end developer.

Back in 2010, I successfully completed my IT Bachelor's studies. I remembered that I really enjoyed creating websites at that time. Although I had some IT knowledge and retained much of what I had learned, I was aware that web development had evolved significantly over the years. Consequently, I knew I had to put in a lot of effort to update my skills.

This portfolio and the projects in it reflect what I learned from online classes, documents, and my own practice.

Upon gaining sufficient proficiency, I started working as a Front-end developer. Since then, I have been continuously enhancing my skills and expanding my knowledge. However, this portfolio showcases what I accomplished after just a few months of self-teaching.

I updated some of the projects. the changes mainly involved optimizing the code and incorporating newer solutions, such as using React Hooks instead of life cycle methods. Nonetheless, the core of the code still represents the skills I acquired during my self-teaching phase.
